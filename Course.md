•	What are the kinds of problems we see in the nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)
1.	**Iteration:** Repeats a block of code over a sequence or until a condition is met. 
Examples:
- Calculating the sum of numbers in a list using a for loop.
- Printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a while loop.
2.	**Recursion:** A function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until a base condition is met.
Examples:
-	Calculating the factorial of a number (e.g., factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)).
-	Solving the Towers of Hanoi problem with multiple disks.
3.	**Backtracking:** A technique to solve problems by exploring all possibilities and backtracking when a solution path fails.
Examples:
-	Solving a Sudoku puzzle by trying numbers in empty cells and reverting if they lead to a conflict.
-	Finding all paths in a maze by moving in possible directions and backtracking when hitting a dead end.

•	What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth
•	Take away from different design principles from chapter 2 (can use the notes provided)
•	The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
•	The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed
•	Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each
•	Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world
•	Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths
•	Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques.
