## 1) Prioritising road repairs 

**•  Problem:**
This problem arises when roads are damaged due to factors like weather, heavy traffic, wear and tear, or accidents. Roads may deteriorate over time, leading to potholes, cracks, or other hazards that require repair. Without a system in place to assess and prioritize repairs, roads that are more critical may not be fixed promptly.

**• How It Causes Problems:**
When road are not repaired, heavily damaged or high-traffic roads might be ignored, leading to safety hazards, traffic congestion, and accidents. Unaddressed issues can worsen, leading to more expensive repairs and longer delays. It can also disrupt daily life and affect the economy due to transportation inefficiencies.

**• Solution:**
We can use **Merge Sort** to address this problem. The solution is to assess the severity of damage, traffic volume, and potential safety risks to prioritize repairs. Critical roads, such as those with heavy traffic or severe damage, should be addressed first. This ensures that limited resources are used effectively, reducing hazards, improving traffic flow, and lowering long-term repair costs.
